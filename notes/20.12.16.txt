to do:
	- write a program to test the new nrloop.cc versus the old one. need to do so on all different potentials. for some reason the two don't agree to numerical accuracy whereas they certainly should!
	- write a program to input a dim=4 worldline and spit out a dim=2 one.
	- write nrmain2.cc in 2d.
