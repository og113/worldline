    <title>Dependence on cut-off parameters</title>

    Hi Arttu,<br>
    <br>
    I know you are not in next week, so I'm not expecting you to read
    this any time soon but I thought I would just send you some notes on
    my current progress nonetheless. In particular, I have been looking
    at the dependence on the cut-off parameters, <i>\mu</i> (IR) and <i>a</i>
    (UV). Both of these parameters have dimensions of length.<br>
    <b><big><br>
        The IR cut-off </big></b><i><b><big>\mu<br>
          <br>
        </big></b></i>As discussed before, letting <i>\mu</i>-&gt;<i>a</i>,
    removes the cusp counterterm. In this case the angle <i>\gamma, </i>defined
    as the angle between the 3 points centred on the cusp, is large.
    Increasing <i>\mu</i> spreads the cusp out over the neighbouring
    points and hence reduces <i>\gamma</i>. However, this increases the
    curvature of the points neighbouring the cusp and then various
    important inequalities are no longer satisfied. In particular the
    Gaussian curvature (<i>K_G </i>in the plots attached<i>)</i>
    multiplied by <i>a</i> and (ddx.dx)/(dx.dx) (where d denotes a
    discrete derivative along the worldline) are no longer small.
    However, though <i>\mu</i> does change the shape of the cusp its
    effect on the action of the worldline instanton is minimal. Further,
    for <i>\mu</i> above about <i>3*a</i>, the dependence of the
    action on <i>\mu</i> is very weak indeed, as desired.<br>

    <i><br>
    </i>The dependence on the UV cut-off <i>a</i> is much more severe
    than that on <i>\mu</i>, however the dependences are related. The
    dependence on <i>a</i> also becomes more severe nearer the
    threshold. For <i>\mu&gt;&gt;a</i>, the maximum Gaussian curvature
    (excluding the two cusp points), <i><i>K_G,</i></i> becomes
    comparable to <i>1/a</i> at very low energies, around E=0.02, and
    increasing in energies I find that fairly quickly <i>K_G*a&gt;&gt;1</i>.<i>
    </i>This is bad news. However, for <i>\mu=a</i> the story is quite
    different. In this case I find that <i>K_G*a&lt;&lt;1</i> is
    satisfied all the way up to the threshold. However, reducing <i>a</i>
    from <i>\mu=a</i> still shows a strong dependence of the action on
    <i>a</i>, just as in the case where <i>\mu&gt;&gt;a.</i> This all
    seems quite confusing to me.<br>
