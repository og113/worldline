to do:
	- check to see whether it is possible to step from a solution with larger K (e.g. K=11) to one with smaller K, in a region where one can find solutions for larger but not smaller K.
	- find dependence on 'a' of circular solution
	- find dependence on 'a' of near circular solutions
	- if near circular solutions depend on 'a' in similar way, step outwards in 'E' until a difference is found, stepping in 'a' too
	- think about having a fixed number of points with cusp regularization. if it seems like a good idea, add a parameter to do this.
	- think about whether there is really a cusp when V is around. to consider this, assume that there is not a cusp and see what happens.
