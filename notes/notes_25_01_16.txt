notes from discussion with arttu:

	mass of monopole appearing in compact qed:
		- for a particle that is not confined <W>~exp(-m*L)
		- for a monopole this term comes from the self energy, which is <W>~exp(-beta*L/a), so for beta~O(1), the monopole has mass at the lattice scale.
		- however for small beta, i.e. weak coupling (is there not a 1/beta in the self energy?!!!!! CONFUSION), the monopole can be light and therefore propagating.
		- n.b. for very small beta large wilson loops are not supressed and the monopole condenses
		- the case with the light monopole is near a weakly first order phase transition between the ono-dynamical, heavy monopoles and the monopole condensate
		
	changing, while keeping gauge parameter fixed:
		- can add term like j_m^2 to action, where j_m^\mu = \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\partial_\nu F_{\rho\sigma}, which is zero in the absence of monopoles and acts like a mass term for monopoles.
		- adding a negative term of this form pushes the phase transition (mentioned above) to weaker coupling.
		
	relating explicit to implicit monopole theories
		- explicit monopole theories alla Blagojevic and Senjanovic
		- implicit alla Polyakov
		- n.b. j_m^2 term can be written as wordline kinetic term
		- duality transformations like this present in papers citing a paper by peskin in 70's or 80's about duality on the lattice
		- hagen kleinert book called ~ gauge fields in condensed matter, does some comparable duality transformations clearly and explicitly
