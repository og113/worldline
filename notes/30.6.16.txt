so, the thermalDisjoint potential does not seem to be working.

	- externalDisjoint converges for straight line input
	- nonrelDisjoint converges for straight line input and for nonrel input (to two different solutions)
	
looking at mds and delta on first NR iteration:
	- nonrelDisjoint: when lines are too far apart delta acts to move them closer, and vice versa; optimal distance at exactly sqrt(kappa/4.0/pi); delta also acts to move points very slightly in time, all together
	- thermalDisjoint: 
	
	
	



using reduced mass rather that total mass in generating nonrel solution makes the solutions curve more. this change has not yet been implemented in highTempParameters.cc. also unsure about whether it has been fully implemented in highTemp. need to look at how quantities like (rR-rL) change with the reduced mass.
